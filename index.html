			<h1> Change of Plans...</h1>
			<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%"> <strong>We eloped! We decided that the most logical course of action was to just go ahead and get married already. So we did! No, we are not pregnant; yes, we would like to have a proper celebration with everyone. When the time comes for a party, we'll make sure all of you know about it! In the mean time, we'll be waiting out the pandemic happily married. </strong></p>

				<p>Please note that your love and support is all we ask for on our special day. </p>

				<p> Due to the travel complications associated with COVID-19, we are no longer able to take our Honeymoon as planned. As such, the Traveler's Joy link component of our registry has been disabled. If you have already made a contribution, it will still reach us, do not worry. </p>

				<p>Please see our registry link below (click the K icon). Since we are no longer able to take a Honeymoon, we will be updating this part of our registry in the coming weeks. </p>

			<p>Welcome to our wedding website, we can’t wait to celebrate with you.</p>

			<p>We’ve created this website as a convenient and interactive way to share all of the <a href="basics.html"> important details </a> with you in the lead up to our wedding. We wanted to share the preliminary details with everyone as soon as possible, but given that our wedding isn't for a little while, this website is still a work in progress. Check back often for updates!</p>

			<p>This website will be filled to the brim with useful info: you can find <a href="activities.html">great things to do </a> around our venue, a list of <a href="accomodations.html">local accomodations</a>, as well as our <a href="registry.html">registry </a> information. After the wedding, we will also provide information for obtaining <a href="gallery.html"> photos from the event </a></p>

			<p>So have fun, take a look around and keep an eye on your mailbox: official invites will be sent about 6 – 8 months before the event. Invites will include plus-one / family head count information. </p>

			<p>Finally – thank you for your ongoing love and support. We are so excited to share this day with you and look forward to dancing the night away with all of our favorite people!</p>
