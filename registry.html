			<h1> Registry </h1>
			
			<p>Please note that your love and support is all we ask for on our special day. </p>

			<p> Due to the travel complications associated with COVID-19, we are no longer able to take our Honeymoon as planned. As such, the Traveler's Joy link component of our registry has been disabled. If you have already made a contribution, it will likely be refunded to you </p>

			<p>When the two of us sat down to put together this registry, we had a really strange problem. We kept getting the wedding registry equivalent of "writer's block". Our apartment already has many of the comforts of home that are traditionally given as gifts to newlyweds, and we have no intention of moving any time soon. We kept circling back around to the same thing when we asked ourselves "what do we need?"</p>
			<p> We need a gosh darn vacation. </p>
			<p> When we met, we bonded over the idea of traveling to see places all around the world. Since then we have half planned half a dozen different trips that we'd like to take: Iceland, Japan, Portugal, Costa Rica, New Orleans... and we have very seldom been able to make them happen. Both of us are career oriented and work long hours. What we really want and need is the ability to take some time off to spend together, doing something we love. </p>
			<p> To that end we hope that - should you choose to get us a gift - you make that gift a contribution to our honeymoon fund at Traveler's Joy (click the button below). We would be overjoyed to have the opportunity to get some new photos on our travel wall! </p>

			<p> If you would prefer to go through a more traditional wedding registry, don't worry we haven't completely lost our minds.</p>

			<p>Please see our registry link below. Since we are no longer able to take a Honeymoon, we will be updating this part of our registry in the coming weeks. </p>
