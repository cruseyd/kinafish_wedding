			<h3> Old Monterey Cafe </h3>
			<p> You know how every city has that one hole in the wall place that looks like it might have just a bit of PTSD but still has a line out the door? That's this place. If you eat breakfast out just once while you're in Monterey, this is where you want to go. Prices are pretty reasonable too, so you can't really lose, unless you get up late and have to wait in line of course! </p>

			<h3> Schooners Coastal Kitchen & Bar </h3>
			<p> Located downstairs inside the Monterey Plaza Hotel and Spa, this is a great place for an afternoon bite and a cocktail. I'm generally pretty cautious when it comes to recommending pricier restaurants (and I feel like Yelp's $$ rating is a tiny bit optimistic) but this place does give you what you pay for. Plus, you can dine with a view of the ocean - and surprisingly entertaining seabirds - without baking in the sun. Try the crab dip; you won't be disappointed. Unless you hate crab. </p>

			<h3> Old Fisherman's Grotto </h3>
			<p> Monterey is an old fisherman's town. As such, how could you pass up eating at The Old Fisherman's Grotto on the Old Fisherman's Wharf? Joking aside, Monterey has some great seafood restaurants, and this place is the best option that we've found so far. It's just a stone's throw from the wedding venue and hotel to boot. Order their bloody mary if that's your thing. </p>

			<h3> Monterey Bay Aquarium </h3>
			<p> Do I really have to tell you about this place? Well, just in case I do, this is probably the best known attraction in Monterey. The aquarium has over 200 exhibits scattered over 3 acres. Here you can check out everything from sea otters and business geese (penguins) to sharks and jellyfish. This is the only place in the world to maintain a live kelp forest and there are several animals you won't find anywhere else in captivity.</p>
			<p>Like tuna. Go figure. </p>
			<p>It's a great time to be had by all, and <strong>students </strong> and <strong> law enforcement </strong> (folks who carry a badge) get a <strong>sweet discount</strong>! The aquarium is a little further from the hotel and venue than other places on this list. If you're driving, parking can be tricky - especially on the weekend - but it's generally not too hard to find a spot on the street a couple blocks away. </p>

			<h3> Cannery Row </h3>
			<p> Every old town has its canonical historical core; the neighborhood whereby the city came into its own. Cannery Row fulfills that role for Monterey, and after the aquarium it's probably the second best known tourist attraction in the city. This is where you go for your double dose of history and kitsch, maybe some of that old-timey candy, maybe a glass of wine. There's a lot to experience here; so much so that there's a whole <a href="https://canneryrow.com/experience-cannery-row/">website</a> dedicated to everything from cigars to John Steinbeck to Pokemon GO. Yes really.</p>

			<h3> Lover's Point </h3>
			<p>Despite the name, Lover's Point is one of the main family outing destinations in greater Monterey (technically it's in Pacific Grove). Situated up on a rocky precipice with fantastic panoramic views of the whole Monterey Bay, this is where you'll want to go to snap those sweet ocean photos. Between this spot and the aquarium, you'll want to pack that extra camera battery and SD card. Lover's Point also has a small beach and tidepools which can be explored when the ocean recedes. There's a small cafe which pedals all the major foodgroups - corndogs, burgers, and ice cream so packing a lunch is optional. </p>

			<h3> San Carlos Beach </h3>
			<p> There are plenty of beaches in and around Monterey, and you really can't go wrong with any of them. San Carlos Beach is has the nice bonus of being close the Memory Garden - by way of a pleasant shoreline walk which is an attraction in its own right. A small nearby park makes it a great spot to take a lunch to go and enjoy the (hopefully) mildly warm Fall weather. Note that while taking a dip in the ocean is technically valid - and you'll no doubt see folks doing just that - we <strong> are </strong> in California and the water will be colder than... well you get the idea. </p>
